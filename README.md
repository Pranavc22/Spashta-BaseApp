## Concepts Learned
The project has given me the opportunity to learn a lot of new concepts. Here are some of those: 
- Customising different UI components. 
- Using Flutter's default splash screen and customising  it.
- Working with REST APIs. (HTTP POST Request) 
- Authenticating users and storing complex data using SharedPreferences in the device's shared storage.
- Working with snack bars to enhance user experience. 
- Parsing complex JSON structures.
- Using Navigation drawer as a user menu and user settings.
- Releasing the app on the Google Play Store and testing it under different statuses.
