## Concepts Learned
The project has given me the opportunity to learn a lot of new concepts. Here are some of those: 
- Using Flutter's default splash screen and customising  it.
- Working with REST APIs. (HTTP POST Request) 
- Authenticating users and storing data using SharedPreferences in the device's shared storage. 
- Customising different UI components.
